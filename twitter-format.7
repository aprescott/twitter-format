.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Twitter supports simple messages as sequences of characters\. In addition to the syntax for replying to a tweet poster, there are various conventions for non\-reply messages\.
.
.SH "PLAIN TWEETS"
\fImessage\fR
.
.P
The core message is a string of characters which does not begin with \fB@\fR\.
.
.P
There are additional conventions within a message itself\. See the section on \fIMESSAGE CONVENTIONS\fR\.
.
.SH "@\-REPLIES"
\fB@\fR\fIuser\fR \fImessage\fR
.
.P
If \fImessage\fR is preceded with \fB@\fR\fIuser\fR, the tweet will be visible to the user with account name \fIuser\fR and any users who are following both you (as the sender) and \fIuser\fR\.
.
.SH "MENTION\-REPLY"
\fB\.@\fR\fIuser\fR \fImessage\fR
.
.P
If the leading \fB@\fR is preceded by any other character, commonly \fB\.\fR, the message is no longer an @reply tweet and will be visible to anyone following you (as the sender)\.
.
.P
This convention is frequently used to reply to \fIuser\fR\'s tweet while making your reply visible to others, or to refer to \fIuser\fR in a "new" tweet without causing its contents to become invisible to your follows\.
.
.SH "RETWEETING"
\fBRT\fR \fB@\fR\fIuser\fR \fImessage\fR
.
.P
If \fB@\fR is preceded by \fBRT\fR, this is a convention indicating that you are \fIretweeting\fR someone\'s \fImessage\fR\. Doing so makes \fImessage\fR available to all your followers\.
.
.P
\fBMT\fR \fB@\fR\fIuser\fR \fImessage\fR
.
.P
\fBMT\fR, for \fBm\fRodified \fBt\fRweet, is used when the \fImessage\fR would have exceeded the character limit\. This is usually seen in combination with some added comment, otherwise a simple retweet would suffice\.
.
.SH "OVERHEARD SENTENCES"
\fBOH:\fR \fIquote\fR
.
.br
\fBOH\fR \fB@\fR\fIuser\fR\fB:\fR \fIquote\fR
.
.P
If \fImessage\fR begins with \fBOH:\fR, then what follows is a \fIquote\fR (which may or may not be wrapped in actual quotation marks) which has been \fBO\fRver\fBH\fReard\.
.
.P
Sometimes the user is included, such as:
.
.P
\fBOH\fR \fB@\fR\fIuser\fR\fB:\fR \fIquote\fR
.
.P
This means, of course, that \fIuser\fR was overheard saying \fIquote\fR\.
.
.SH "MESSAGE CONVENTIONS"
\fB@\fR\fIusermention\fR
.
.P
\fImessage\fR can itself contain \fB@\fR\fIuser\fR references, called \fImentions\fR, which \fIuser\fR can see\.
.
.P
\fB#\fR\fIhashtag\fR
.
.P
Any words in \fImessage\fR which begin with \fB#\fR are called \fIhashtags\fR and are used to tag the message as related to some particular topic\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
